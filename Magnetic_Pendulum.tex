\section{System Description}
We consider a spring pendulum system where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A mass \( m \) is attached to a spring with a spring constant \( k \) and natural length \( l_0 \).
    \item The mass is free to move in both radial (\( r \)) and angular (\( \theta \)) directions.
    \item The mass is ferromagnetic with a magnetic moment \( \mu \), and is influenced by an oscillating magnetic field \( B(t) \).
    \item The system is also subject to gravity, with gravitational acceleration \( g \).
\end{itemize}

\caption{A diagram of the spring pendulum system with a ferromagnetic mass influenced by an oscillating magnetic field. The mass \( m \) is attached to the end of the spring, which extends from the fixed support. The system is free to move in both the radial (\( r \)) and angular (\( \theta \)) directions. The mass has a magnetic moment \( \mu \), which interacts with the oscillating magnetic field \( B(t) \), depicted by a red arrow. The blue arrow represents the magnetic force \( F_m \), which affects the angular motion. The diagram also shows the coordinate system (\( x \), \( y \)) and generalized coordinates \( r \) and \( \theta \).}
\label{fig:spring_pendulum}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Generalized Coordinates}
The system is described by the following coordinates:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( r(t) \): The length of the spring.
    \item \( \theta(t) \): The angular displacement of the pendulum from the vertical.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Kinetic Energy}
The velocity of the mass can be expressed as:
\[
v^2 = \dot{r}^2 + r^2\dot{\theta}^2
\]
Thus, the kinetic energy is:
\[
T = \frac{1}{2}m\left( \dot{r}^2 + r^2\dot{\theta}^2 \right)
\]

\subsection{Potential Energy}
The potential energy includes:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Gravitational Potential:}
    \[
    U_g = -mgr\cos\theta
    \]
    \item \textbf{Spring Potential:}
    \[
    U_s = \frac{1}{2}k(r - l_0)^2
    \]
    \item \textbf{Magnetic Interaction:}
    Assuming the magnetic field oscillates as \( B(t) = B_0\cos(\omega t) \), the magnetic potential energy is:
    \[
    U_m = -\mu B(t)\cos\theta = -\mu B_0\cos(\omega t)\cos\theta
    \]
\end{enumerate}

The total potential energy is:
\[
U = -mgr\cos\theta + \frac{1}{2}k(r - l_0)^2 - \mu B_0\cos(\omega t)\cos\theta
\]

\subsection{Lagrangian}
The Lagrangian is defined as:
\[
\mathcal{L} = T - U
\]
Substituting the expressions for \( T \) and \( U \):
\[
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2}m\left( \dot{r}^2 + r^2\dot{\theta}^2 \right) + mgr\cos\theta - \frac{1}{2}k(r - l_0)^2 + \mu B_0\cos(\omega t)\cos\theta
\]
\\\\
\section{Equations of Motion}
The equations of motion are derived using the Euler-Lagrange equations:
\[
\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{q}_i}\right) - \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial q_i} = 0
\]
where \( q_i \) are the generalized coordinates.

\subsection{Radial Motion (\( r \))}
\[
m\ddot{r} - mr\dot{\theta}^2 + k(r - l_0) - mg\cos\theta = 0
\]

\subsection{Angular Motion (\( \theta \))}
\[
\frac{d}{dt}\left(mr^2\dot{\theta}\right) + mgr\sin\theta - \mu B_0\cos(\omega t)\sin\theta = 0
\]
\\\\
\section{Numerical Methodology for the Spring Pendulum with Magnetic Interaction}
This section provides an overview of numerical methods for solving the coupled differential equations derived from the Lagrangian formulation of the spring pendulum system. The equations of motion for the radial (\( r \)) and angular (\( \theta \)) directions involve time-dependent terms, nonlinear coupling, and periodic forcing due to the oscillating magnetic field. Thus, robust numerical schemes are essential to ensure stability, accuracy, and computational efficiency.

\section{Numerical Schemes Considered}

\subsection{Euler Method}
The Euler method is a straightforward first-order numerical scheme. Given an ordinary differential equation (ODE) of the form:
\[
\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y),
\]
the Euler method approximates the solution as:
\[
y_{n+1} = y_n + h f(t_n, y_n),
\]
where \( h \) is the time step size. While simple to implement, the Euler method is conditionally stable and can accumulate significant numerical error, especially for stiff or oscillatory systems \cite{press2007numerical}.

\subsection{Verlet Integration}
Verlet integration is widely used for conservative systems. It approximates the position and velocity using:
\[
r_{n+1} = 2r_n - r_{n-1} + h^2 a_n,
\]
where \( a_n \) is the acceleration at time step \( n \). This method is second-order accurate, time-reversible, and conserves energy over long simulations. However, it is less efficient when velocity-dependent terms are present \cite{hairer1993solving}.

\subsection{Runge-Kutta Methods (RK4 and RK45)}
The fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method provides a high degree of accuracy. It updates the solution as:
\[
y_{n+1} = y_n + \frac{h}{6}(k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4),
\]
where:
\[
k_1 = f(t_n, y_n), \quad
k_2 = f\left(t_n + \frac{h}{2}, y_n + \frac{h}{2}k_1\right),
\]
\[
k_3 = f\left(t_n + \frac{h}{2}, y_n + \frac{h}{2}k_2\right), \quad
k_4 = f(t_n + h, y_n + hk_3).
\]
The adaptive version (RK45) dynamically adjusts \( h \) based on error estimates, making it more efficient for varying dynamics \cite{press2007numerical}.

\subsection{Implicit Backward Euler Method}
The backward Euler method is a first-order implicit scheme, given by:
\[
y_{n+1} = y_n + h f(t_{n+1}, y_{n+1}).
\]
This method is unconditionally stable and effective for stiff systems, but requires iterative solvers to handle the implicit nature \cite{ascher1998computer}.

\subsection{Crank-Nicolson Method}
The Crank-Nicolson method combines forward and backward Euler schemes:
\[
y_{n+1} = y_n + \frac{h}{2}\left[f(t_n, y_n) + f(t_{n+1}, y_{n+1})\right].
\]
This second-order implicit method is stable and accurate for oscillatory systems \cite{hairer1993solving}.

\subsection{Leapfrog Method}
The leapfrog method updates positions and velocities alternately:
\[
r_{n+1} = r_n + h v_{n+1/2}, \quad
v_{n+3/2} = v_{n+1/2} + h a_{n+1}.
\]
It is time-reversible, energy-conserving, and suitable for conservative systems, but less effective for systems with strong damping or stiffness \cite{landau2015survey}.

\subsection{Symplectic Integrators}
Symplectic integrators, such as the velocity Verlet or implicit midpoint rule, are designed for Hamiltonian systems. For the implicit midpoint rule:
\[
y_{n+1} = y_n + h f\left(\frac{t_n + t_{n+1}}{2}, \frac{y_n + y_{n+1}}{2}\right).
\]
These methods preserve energy and momentum over long simulations but require implicit solvers \cite{hairer1993solving}.

\subsection{Exponential Integrators}
Exponential integrators solve linear components of ODEs analytically using:
\[
y_{n+1} = e^{Ah}y_n + \int_0^h e^{A\tau}g(y_n)d\tau,
\]
where \( A \) represents the linear operator. These methods are ideal for oscillatory systems or systems with stiffness \cite{ascher1998computer}.

\subsection{ Multiscale Methods}
Multiscale methods address systems with multiple timescales by separating fast and slow dynamics. The heterogeneous multiscale method (HMM) is one example, where a reduced model is used for the slow dynamics, while the fast dynamics are simulated only as needed \cite{hairer1993solving}.

\subsection{Geometric Integrators}
Geometric integrators, such as discrete gradient methods, preserve invariants like energy or angular momentum. These methods are particularly useful for long-term simulations of conservative systems \cite{landau2015survey}.

\subsection{Methodology Selection}
Considering the nonlinear coupling, oscillatory dynamics, and periodic forcing in the spring pendulum system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item RK4 is the preferred choice for its high accuracy and efficiency in solving nonlinear systems.
    \item Adaptive RK45 is recommended for simulations with varying dynamics or fast transitions.
    \item Symplectic integrators are suitable for long-term energy conservation in undamped or weakly damped systems.
\end{itemize}


Based on these considerations:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The Euler method is unsuitable due to its low accuracy and conditional stability.
    \item Verlet integration is effective for conservative dynamics but less ideal for velocity-dependent damping or magnetic forces.
    \item The RK4 method offers high accuracy and is appropriate for the nonlinear coupled equations of motion, making it the preferred choice.
    \item Implicit methods, such as backward Euler or Crank-Nicolson, are robust but computationally expensive due to the implicit nature.
    \item The leapfrog method is suitable for conservative dynamics but less flexible for velocity-dependent forces.
\end{enumerate}

Thus, the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method (RK4) is selected for its balance between accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency.

\section{Numerical Results and Visualizations}

The numerical simulation of the spring pendulum system with magnetic interaction was performed using the fourth-order adaptive Runge-Kutta method (RK45). The system's dynamics were visualized using animations, phase portraits, and a Poincaré map, as described below.

\subsection{Animation of the System Dynamics}
A GIF animation was created to visualize the motion of the spring pendulum over time. The animation captures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The oscillatory motion of the mass in the radial and angular directions.
    \item The periodic forcing due to the oscillating magnetic field.
    \item Real-time display of the system's configuration, including the spring and pendulum motion.
\end{itemize}
The animation provides an intuitive understanding of the coupled dynamics of the system, highlighting the influence of the magnetic field and nonlinear coupling. The GIF file is named \texttt{spring\_pendulum.gif}.

\subsection{Radial Phase Portrait}

\]
This visualization highlights the oscillatory behavior in the radial direction, showing the cyclic nature of the spring's extension and compression.

T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}.
\]
This map provides insights into the system's stability and periodicity, showing how the dynamics evolve over successive periods of the magnetic forcing.

    \item The Poincaré map shows the influence of periodic magnetic forcing, revealing patterns of stability or chaos depending on the system's parameters.
    \item The animation provides an intuitive visualization of how the magnetic field modulates the spring and pendulum dynamics in real-time.
\end{itemize}
These visualizations collectively provide a comprehensive understanding of the spring pendulum's behavior under magnetic forcing.

\section{Magnetic Interaction Modeling}

This section focuses on refining the magnetic field model and incorporating enhanced magnetic forces into the spring pendulum system. These refinements allow for a more accurate representation of the ferromagnetic interaction and its impact on system dynamics.

\subsection{Enhanced Magnetic Field Model}
The magnetic field is extended to include spatial and temporal variations:
\[
\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}, t) = B_0 \cos(\omega t) \hat{z} + \nabla \Phi(\mathbf{r}),
\]
where \( \Phi(\mathbf{r}) \) can represent spatial variations, such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A uniform field: \( \Phi(\mathbf{r}) = 0 \).
    \item A dipole field:
    \[
    \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{3(\mathbf{m} \cdot \hat{r}) \hat{r} - \mathbf{m}}{r^3}.
    \]
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Nonlinear Magnetic Force}
The magnetic force acting on the mass is expressed as:
\[
\mathbf{F}_m = \nabla (\mu \cdot \mathbf{B}) = \mu (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B}) + (\mu \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{B}.
\]
Nonlinear effects such as magnetic hysteresis and saturation can be included:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hysteresis:} The magnetic moment \( \mu \) depends on the history of \( B(t) \).
    \item \textbf{Saturation:} The magnetic moment asymptotically approaches a maximum value:
    \[
    \mu(B) = \frac{\mu_{\text{max}} B}{B + B_s}.
    \]
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Updated Equations of Motion}
The equations of motion are modified to include the enhanced magnetic force terms:
\[
\ddot{r} = r \dot{\theta}^2 - \frac{k}{m}(r - l_0) + g \cos\theta + \frac{\mu}{m} \frac{\partial B}{\partial r},
\]
\[
\ddot{\theta} = -\frac{2 \dot{r} \dot{\theta}}{r} - \frac{g}{r} \sin\theta + \frac{\mu}{m r} \frac{\partial B}{\partial \theta}.
\]

\subsection{Numerical Implementation}
The numerical solver is updated to include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Computation of the refined magnetic field \( \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}, t) \).
    \item Inclusion of nonlinear magnetic forces \( \mathbf{F}_m \) in the equations of motion.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{5. Analysis and Visualization}
To assess the impact of the refined magnetic modeling, the following visualizations are generated:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Phase Portraits:} Compare the radial and angular phase space trajectories.
    \item \textbf{Poincaré Maps:} Highlight differences in periodicity and stability.
    \item \textbf{Time-Series Plots:} Illustrate changes in the radial and angular motion over time.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Discussion}
The refined magnetic interaction modeling provides a more realistic representation of the ferromagnetic system. The added complexity introduces new dynamics, including stronger nonlinear coupling and potential chaotic behavior.

\subsection{Numerical Techniques}
The equations of motion for the spring pendulum system are solved using the RK45 method, which adapts the time step to balance accuracy and efficiency. The Python implementation includes enhancements for capturing nonlinear effects, especially in the presence of an oscillating magnetic field.

\subsection{Enhanced Magnetics}
The magnetic field model was extended to include dynamic behavior based on saturation effects. The interaction between the magnetic field and the ferromagnetic mass was modeled as:
\[
\mathbf{F}_m = \nabla (\mu \cdot \mathbf{B}),
\]
where \( \mu \) is the magnetic moment, which varies dynamically according to:
\[
\mu(B) = \frac{\mu_{\text{max}} B}{B + B_s}.
\]

\subsubsection{Radial Phase Portrait}
The radial phase portrait, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:radial_phase_portrait_magnetic}, plots the spring length \( r \) versus its radial velocity \( \dot{r} \). It illustrates the periodic oscillations in the radial direction, highlighting nonlinear coupling introduced by the magnetic interaction.

    \caption{Angular phase portrait: \( \theta \) vs. \( \dot{\theta} \). Nonlinear effects from the magnetic forcing are evident.}
    \label{fig:angular_phase_portrait_magnetic}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Poincaré Map}
The Poincaré map, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:poincare_map_magnetic}, samples the angular displacement \( \theta \) and angular velocity \( \dot{\theta} \) at intervals corresponding to the period of the magnetic field:
\[
T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}.
\]
The map captures periodicity and chaotic behavior in the system's dynamics.

    \caption{Poincaré map: \( \theta \) vs. \( \dot{\theta} \) sampled at the period of the magnetic field.}
    \label{fig:poincare_map_magnetic}
\end{figure}

    \item Coupled radial and angular motion.
    \item The influence of the magnetic field on the pendulum's dynamics.
    \item Real-time visualization of the spring's oscillations and pendulum's angular motion.
\end{itemize}
The animation is saved as a GIF file, named \texttt{spring\_pendulum\_magnetic.gif}.

\subsection{Discussion}
The enhanced magnetic interaction introduces complex nonlinear effects into the system, resulting in more intricate dynamics. Visualizations, including phase portraits and Poincaré maps, reveal the interplay between periodic forcing and nonlinear coupling. The numerical simulation demonstrates the system's sensitivity to parameter changes, offering insights into chaotic and quasi-periodic behavior.

The refined magnetic model adds depth to the analysis of the spring pendulum system, capturing nonlinear effects and enhancing the realism of the simulation. Future work can explore the system's behavior under varying damping and additional external forces.
